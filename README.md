This repo will act as the home of my self-teaching of Lua - including my created scripts, notes, and updates on my progress.

Created [*how_to_setup_lua.txt*](https://github.com/julch94/learning-lua/blob/main/how_to_setup_lua.txt) as I walked through the Lua wiki with steps for setting up on Windows. The process was complex but not all that complicated. I first got Lua working on my laptop while writing this guide, and put them to the test while setting up Lua on my desktop. After setting up on my desktop, I was able to create and test [helloWorld.lua](https://github.com/julch94/learning-lua/blob/main/helloWorld.lua) - a simple "Hello World" script which works! 

Next up is to start taking the [Codecadamy Learn Lua Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-lua). The course has 4 main modules and takes about 8 hours, so 2 hours per module split over about a week. My objective is to complete all scripts outside of the codecadamy browser, on my own machine, and document them (along with their results) on this repo.

I went ahead and knocked out [Module 1 - Welcome to Learn Lua](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-lua/modules/welcome-to-learn-lua). In this module I created [module-1-3-stacked.lua](https://github.com/julch94/learning-lua/blob/main/module-1-3-stacked.lua) -  a script that draws a stack of printed numbers displayed in a stacked manner, like so:
